Welcome to the Nordic Quantum Autumn School 2025! This opening session will introduce participants to the school, the structure, learning outcomes and logistics. An introduction about ENCCS and EuroHPC-JU as well with an overview of the five-day program, introduce the instructors, and set expectations for the intensive quantum computing week ahead.

## Introduction to MIMER AI Factory
**Speaker:** Thor Wikfeldt (MIMER/RISE, SE)  
**Time:** 9:40-10:00

You will get a welcoming message from the director of MIMER AI factory and understand more details on the AI factory initiative.

## Introduction to the European HPC+AI+QC ecosystem. LUMI-Q Quantum Flagship
**Speaker:** Mikael Johansson (CSC, FI)  
**Time:** 10:00-11:00

This session provides a comprehensive overview of the European landscape for hybrid classical/quantum high-performance computing. We'll explore the LUMI-Q Quantum Flagship initiative and discuss how quantum computing is being integrated into the broader European HPC and AI ecosystem. Participants will learn about current infrastructure, future developments, and opportunities for accessing quantum resources.

## Coffee break
**Time:** 10:40-11:00

## Overview of the HPC/QC software stack, from ready-made Q-libraries for common tasks to circuit level assembly and hardware-level coding
**Speaker:** Miroslav Dobsicek
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

A technical deep-dive into the software ecosystem that connects classical high-performance computing with quantum computing. This session covers the full stack from ready-made quantum libraries for common tasks down to circuit-level assembly and hardware-level programming.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00

## Quantum gates, circuits and algorithms
**Speakers:** Juan de Gracia Triviño (ENCCS/RISE, SE)
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Building on the previous session, we'll explore how quantum circuits are used to implement quantum algorithms. This session bridges the gap between basic gate operations and practical quantum algorithms, showing how circuit design principles apply to real quantum computing problems.

## Quantum gates and circuits
**Speaker:** Giulia Ferrini (MC2, Chalmers/WACQT, SE)  
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Introduction to the fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. This session covers basic quantum gates, how they manipulate qubits, and how gates are combined to create quantum circuits.

## Coffee break
**Time:** 15:00-15:30

## Quantum Information Theory introduction, building quantum algorithm, QFT, ...
**Speaker:** Stefano Markidis (KTH, SE)  
**Time:** 15:30-16:30

An introduction to the theoretical foundations of quantum information processing. This session covers key concepts including quantum superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurements. We'll discuss the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and other fundamental quantum algorithms, providing the theoretical background needed for advanced quantum computing applications. This is an excellent foundation to learn how to build a quantum algorithm.

## From qubits 2000 to Nobel Prize 2025
**Speaker:** Göran Wendin (RISE, SE)  
**Time:** 16:30-17:30

Learn about the technological advances that led to the recent nobel prize winning
