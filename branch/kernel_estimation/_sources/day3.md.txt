*Learning Track: Intermediate - Variational algorithms, Molecules, VQE use cases*

## Introduction to variational quantum algorithms: VQE and beyond (OPE, ..., SQD)
**Speaker:** Juan (ENCCS, RISE, SE)  
**Time:** 9:00-10:00

Comprehensive overview of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) and related algorithms including Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and quantum simulation methods. This session covers the theoretical foundations of variational quantum algorithms and their applications to quantum chemistry and materials science.

## VQE applied to use cases for quantum chemistry/drug discovery with description of specific use cases
**Speaker:** Panagiotis Barkoutsos (IonQ)  
**Time:** 10:00-10:40

Deep dive into practical applications of VQE for quantum chemistry and drug discovery. This session presents specific use cases, discusses the advantages of quantum approaches over classical methods, and explores current limitations and future prospects for quantum-enhanced molecular simulation.

## Coffee Break
**Time:** 10:40-11:00

## High Ground State Overlap via Quantum Embedding Methods
**Speaker:** Matthias Christandl (København U, DK)  
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

Advanced techniques for achieving high ground state overlap using quantum embedding methods. This session covers sophisticated approaches to quantum simulation of complex systems by embedding them in larger quantum systems, with applications to condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00

## Excursion Session: Controlling a Quantum Computer Using Pulses
**Speaker:** Stefan Seegerer (IQM)  
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Leave the gate model behind and dive into the microwave layer where quantum logic is born. Through interactive demos you’ll be gaining an intuitive feel for how precise analog signals steer digital-era quantum computation.

## Interactive tutorial on the devices (LUMI-Q/IQM devices)
**Speaker:** Stefan Seegerer (IQM)  
**Time:** 14:00-15:00

Interactive tutorial providing direct experience with LUMI-Q quantum simulator and IQM quantum devices. Participants will learn to submit jobs, monitor execution, and retrieve results from these quantum computing platforms. This practical session bridges theory and application.

## Coffee Break
**Time:** 15:00-15:30

## Interactive tutorial: Execution of simple quantum chemistry simulation VQE vs LUMI-Q/IQM
**Speakers:** IQM team/Panos (Hands-on)  
**Time:** 15:30-16:30

Advanced tutorial comparing VQE implementation on quantum simulators versus real LUMI-Q/IQM quantum hardware. Participants will execute quantum chemistry examples and analyze the differences between simulated and real quantum computations.

## Buffé Dinner
**Time:** 16:30-17:30

Special dinner event for all participants and instructors.
