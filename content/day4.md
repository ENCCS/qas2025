## Accelerated Quantum Supercomputing using NVIDIA CUDA-Q
**Speaker:** Esperanza Cuenca-Gómez (NVIDIA)
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

GPU-accelerated workloads are increasingly being adopted in heterogeneous quantum-classical architectures. These workloads are used to speed up algorithm run time, to test and implement future parallel QPU workflows, to scale up the size of quantum research, and to deploy workflows where QPUs and GPUs are tightly coupled. This session explains NVIDIA’s vision of accelerated quantum supercomputing, introducing CUDA-Q as the platform for high-performance hybrid quantum-classical computing. Relevant works using CUDA-Q are presented. The session includes code examples on how to use CUDA-Q, including quantum kernels and hybrid quantum-classical applications. Attendees are encouraged to explore CUDA-Q and the resources provided after the session.
