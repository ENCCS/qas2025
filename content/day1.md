**Speaker:** Miroslav Dobsicek
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

A technical deep-dive into the software ecosystem that connects classical high-performance computing with quantum computing. This session covers the full stack from ready-made quantum libraries for common tasks down to circuit-level assembly and hardware-level programming.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00

## Quantum gates, circuits and algorithms
**Speakers:** Juan de Gracia Triviño (ENCCS/RISE, SE)
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Building on the previous session, we'll explore how quantum circuits are used to implement quantum algorithms. This session bridges the gap between basic gate operations and practical quantum algorithms, showing how circuit design principles apply to real quantum computing problems.

## Quantum gates and circuits
**Speaker:** Giulia Ferrini (MC2, Chalmers/WACQT, SE)  
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Introduction to the fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. This session covers basic quantum gates, how they manipulate qubits, and how gates are combined to create quantum circuits.

## Coffee break
**Time:** 15:00-15:30

## Quantum Information Theory introduction, building quantum algorithm, QFT, ...
**Speaker:** Stefano Markidis (KTH, SE)  
**Time:** 15:30-16:30

An introduction to the theoretical foundations of quantum information processing. This session covers key concepts including quantum superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurements. We'll discuss the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and other fundamental quantum algorithms, providing the theoretical background needed for advanced quantum computing applications. This is an excellent foundation to learn how to build a quantum algorithm.
