## Welcome & Introduction to QAS2025
**Speaker:** Thor Wikfeldt (ENCCS/RISE, SE)  
**Time:** 9:00-10:00

Welcome to the Nordic Quantum Autumn School 2025! This opening session will introduce participants to the school's objectives, structure, and learning outcomes. We'll provide an overview of the five-day program, introduce the instructors, and set expectations for the intensive quantum computing education ahead.

## Introduction to the European HPC+AI+QC ecosystem. LUMI-Q Quantum Flagship
**Speaker:** Mikael Johansson (CSC, FI)  
**Time:** 10:00-10:40

This session provides a comprehensive overview of the European landscape for hybrid classical/quantum high-performance computing. We'll explore the LUMI-Q Quantum Flagship initiative and discuss how quantum computing is being integrated into the broader European HPC and AI ecosystem. Participants will learn about current infrastructure, future developments, and opportunities for accessing quantum resources.

## Coffee Break
**Time:** 10:40-11:00

## Overview of the HPC/QC software stack, from ready-made Q-libraries for common tasks to circuit level assembly and hardware-level
**Speaker:** Miroslav Dobsicek (Chalmers Next Labs, SE)  
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

A technical deep-dive into the software ecosystem that connects classical high-performance computing with quantum computing. This session covers the full stack from ready-made quantum libraries for common tasks down to circuit-level assembly and hardware-level programming. We'll discuss how quantum algorithms integrate with classical computing workflows and the tools available for hybrid quantum-classical computing.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00

## Quantum gates and circuits
**Speaker:** Giulia Ferrini (MC2, Chalmers/WACQT, SE)  
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Introduction to the fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. This session covers basic quantum gates, how they manipulate qubits, and how gates are combined to create quantum circuits. We'll explore single-qubit and two-qubit gates, quantum circuit notation, and the principles of quantum circuit design.

## Quantum gates, circuits and algorithms
**Speakers:** Giulia Ferrini, Laura Garcia Alvarez (MC2, Chalmers/WACQT, SE)  
**Time:** 14:00-15:00

Building on the previous session, we'll explore how quantum circuits are used to implement quantum algorithms. This session bridges the gap between basic gate operations and practical quantum algorithms, showing how circuit design principles apply to real quantum computing problems.

## Coffee Break
**Time:** 15:00-15:30

## Quantum Information Theory introduction, building quantum algorithm, QFT, ...
**Speaker:** Stefano Markidis (KTH, SE)  
**Time:** 15:30-16:30

An introduction to the theoretical foundations of quantum information processing. This session covers key concepts including quantum superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurements. We'll discuss the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and other fundamental quantum algorithms, providing the theoretical background needed for advanced quantum computing applications.

## Quantum error mitigation (QEM) applied to simulation of physical systems
**Speaker:** GÃ¶ran Wendin (RISE, SE)  
**Time:** 16:30-17:30

Current quantum computers are noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices that require error mitigation strategies. This session introduces quantum error mitigation techniques applied to simulation of physical systems. We'll cover practical approaches to reducing the impact of quantum noise and improving the reliability of quantum computations.

## Reception & Mingling
**Time:** 18:00-20:00

Welcome reception and networking event for all participants and instructors.
