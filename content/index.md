## About the school

The Quantum Autumn School 2025 (QAS2025) brings together researchers, students, and industry professionals to explore cutting-edge developments in quantum computing. This 5-day event offers a unique combination of theoretical foundations and practical experience emphasising the integration with High Performance Computing, featuring expert-led sessions that cover a range of topics from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Expect a blend of lectures, hands-on exercises, and networking opportunities, including the chance to interact with stakeholders involved with the [EuroHPC JU quantum computers](https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-quantum-computers_en). It will provide a valuable opportunity to explore the latest advancements in quantum computing, where you'll learn about up-to-date topics and European quantum efforts, especially in light of the eight [EuroHPC JU quantum computers announcements](https://www.eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-quantum-computers_en), and get hands-on experience.

:::{dropdown} What you will learn

QAS2025 will cover a broad range of topics that will give you a solid foundation in theoretical concepts and the practical know-how to get started with quantum computing in your domain. Starting from introductory lectures and basic tutorials at the first days of the school and building up to intermediate and advanced topics towards the end.

**Introduction to quantum algorithms:** Get a quick introduction on quantum computing, quantum information theory and learn how to develop a quantum algorithm. Understand the logic behind, and be able to programmatically create, quantum gates, circuits and algorithms such as QAOA and VQE with their different variations

**Hands-on experience with a quantum computer:** run computational workloads on real quantum hardware, with potential access to EuroHPC JU quantum device like LUMI-Q

**European quantum initiatives:** get an understanding and overview of the quantum computing ecosystem in Europe and globally, including key European quantum initiatives and talks by European hardware providers: IQM and Pasqal

**Use cases:** familiarise yourself with use cases in key domains such as optimisation, quantum chemistry and quantum finance. Learn about the exciting intersection between quantum computing and neural networks with overview on quantum reservoir computing

**Quantum packages:** use common quantum SDKs as Qiskit, Pennylane, learn about the European quantum algorithm development package Qrisp and how to accelerate quantum algorithms using QUDA-Q

**Error correction:** understand quantum error correction and the difference with quantum error mitigation

**HPC & QC workflows:** understand how to run hybrid HPC-QC workflows and accelerate quantum algorithms on GPUs.
