# Getting Your Environment Ready

*Prepare your computing environment for the Quantum Autumn School 2025*

While preparation is optional, getting familiar with these resources will help you hit the ground running!

## Quick Start: Environment Setup

Watch this **[short video by Stefan from IQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYD87xxlxJU)** to learn how to set up your environment for the school:
- Covers Jupyter notebook setup and basic quantum computing tools
- Great introduction to get you started

## Recommended Resources

### 1. Previous Schools & Materials

Explore materials from our previous quantum schools to get familiar with the topics and format:

- Available at: [https://enccs.se/lessons/](https://enccs.se/lessons/)
- Browse through previous quantum computing lessons
- Get a feel for our teaching style and content depth

### 2. IQM Academy

Get hands-on experience with quantum hardware before the school:

- Sign up at IQM Resonance cloud
- Access rich tutorials and learning materials
- Try IQM QPUs hands-on
- Perfect complement to the theoretical foundations

### 3. Jupyter Notebooks

Prepare your environment to run Jupyter notebooks:

- Install Jupyter on your local machine or use cloud-based solutions
- Detailed setup steps available on our website
- We'll guide you through specifics during the pre-event check-in call

### 4. Get Familiar with Qrisp

Explore the European quantum SDK before the school:

- **[Qrisp](https://qrisp.eu/)** - European quantum algorithm development package
- We'll have a special focus on Qrisp during the school
- Great opportunity to get a head start on this powerful tool

### 5. Excellent Lectures and Readings

Strengthen your quantum computing foundations with these resources:

**Ronald de Wolf's Quantum Computing Course:**
- **[Ronald de Wolf (CWI and ILLC)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/)** offers excellent quantum computing course materials
- Course website: [https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qc25.html](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qc25.html)
- Lecture notes (PDF): [https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf)
- Highly recommended reading to strengthen your quantum computing foundations

**Quantum Algorithm Zoo:**
- **[Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)** - Excellent summary of available quantum algorithms and related implementations
- Citation: [BibTeX reference](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/zoo.bib)
- Comprehensive catalogue of quantum algorithms organized by application domain

:::{important}
**Don't worry if you don't complete all of thisâ€”we'll guide you through the essentials during the school!**

The goal is to give you a head start, not to overwhelm you. Even if you arrive with no preparation, you'll be able to follow along and learn.
