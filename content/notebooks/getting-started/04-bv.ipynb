This is important to prevent any unintended interference in subsequent operations or measurements. In the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, since the ancilla qubit is only used to facilitate the oracle's function, it can be left in its final state after the oracle operation without affecting the outcome of the algorithm. However, if you were to use the ancilla qubit in further computations, you would need to apply the inverse of the operations performed on it during the oracle implementation to return it to its original state.\n",
