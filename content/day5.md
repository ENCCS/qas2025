# Day 5 - Friday, November 7th

*Learning Track: Quantum machine learning and introduction to quantum reservoir computing*

## Quantum neural networks (lecture)
**Speaker:** Stefano Markidis (KTH, SE)  
**Time:** 9:00-10:00

Theoretical foundations of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and quantum machine learning. This lecture covers the principles of quantum-enhanced machine learning and quantum neural network.

## Hands-on QNNs using pennylane for classification (tutorial)
**Speaker:** Stefano Markidis (KTH, SE)  
**Time:** 10:00-10:40

Practical tutorial on implementing Quantum Neural Networks using PennyLane for classification tasks.

## Coffee break
**Time:** 10:40-11:00

## Quantum reservoir computing
**Speaker:** Ruben Pariente Bassa (SINTEF, NO)  
**Time:** 11:00-12:00
introduction to Quantum reservoir computing.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00


## Closing and see you next year (hopefully!)
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

Wrap-up session summarizing key learnings from the five-day intensive program. Participants will have the opportunity to share insights, discuss future applications of quantum computing in their work, and network with instructors and fellow participants.
