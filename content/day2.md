# Day 2 - Tuesday, November 4th

*Learning Track: Basic/Intermediate - Optimization, QAOA and overview on hybrid use cases*

## Introduction to variational quantum algorithms: QAOA
**Speaker:** Franz Fuchs (SINTEF, UiO, NO)  
**Time:** 9:00-10:00

Introduction to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), one of the most promising near-term quantum algorithms. This session covers the theoretical foundations of QAOA, its applications to combinatorial optimization problems, and why it's particularly suited for NISQ devices.

## In-depth description of variational quantum algorithms: QAOA
**Speaker:** Franz Fuchs (SINTEF, UiO, NO)  
**Time:** 10:00-10:40

A detailed exploration of QAOA implementation and optimization strategies.

## Coffee break
**Time:** 10:40-11:00

## Opportunities for extending quantum computing through subspace, embedding and classical molecular dynamics techniques
**Speaker:** Thomas M. Bickley (UCL, UK)
**Time:** 11:00-12:00

The advent of hybrid computing platforms consisting of quantum processing units integrated with conventional high-performance computing brings new opportunities for algorithm design. By strategically offloading select portions of the workload to classical hardware where tractable, we may broaden the applicability of quantum computation in the near term. In this talk, we review techniques that facilitate the study of subdomains of chemical systems with quantum computers and present a proof-of-concept demonstration of quantum-selected configuration interaction deployed within a multiscale/multiphysics simulation workflow leveraging classical molecular dynamics, projection-based embedding and qubit subspace tools. This allows the technology to be utilised for simulating systems of real scientific and industrial interest, which not only brings true quantum utility closer to realisation but is also relevant as we look forward to the fault-tolerant regime.

## Lunch
**Time:** 12:00-13:00

## Getting started with algorithm development on actual quantum hardware using IQM Resonance
**Speaker:** Stefan Seegerer (IQM)  
**Time:** 13:00-14:00

In this session you will be learning how to execute quantum circuits on actual hardware with IQM’s cloud-accessible Resonance platform. You will not only run your first experiments but also acquire tips and tricks on how to get the most out of the hardware.

## Developing quantum algorithms with qrisp—the next generation of quantum algorithm development
**Speaker:** Stefan Seegerer (IQM)
**Time:** 14:00-15:00

This hands-on session introduces qrisp’s high-level, Pythonic workflow that converts mathematical intent directly into resource-optimized quantum circuits. Participants will prototype variational and fault-tolerant routines, run it on simulators and real hardware and experience first hand how qrisp empowers you to develop novel quantum algorithms.

## Coffee break
