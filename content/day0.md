## Environment setup to run calculations yourself

:::{dropdown} How to install qrisp and run simple calculations

Get ready for the school with these optional preparation materials and resources.

:::{important}
**Don't worry if you don't complete all of this‚Äîwe'll guide you through the essentials during the school!**

The goal is to give you a head start, not to overwhelm you. Even if you arrive with no preparation, you'll be able to follow along and learn.


### Quick start: Environment setup

Watch this **[short video by Stefan from IQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYD87xxlxJU)** to learn how to set up your environment for the school:
- Covers Jupyter notebook setup and basic quantum computing examples
- Great introduction to get you started

:::{tip}
If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, don't worry! Stefan's video above provides a great introduction, and we'll walk through everything during the school.

:::{dropdown} Get familiar with Qrisp

Explore the European quantum SDK before the school:

- **[Qrisp](https://qrisp.eu/)** - European quantum algorithm development package
- We'll have a special focus on Qrisp during the school
- Great opportunity to get a head start on this powerful tool

#### Hands-on: Qrisp starter notebook

Get practical experience with our interactive **[Qrisp Starter Tutorial](notebooks/getting-started/qrisp-starter-tutorial)**!

**What you'll learn:**
- Setting up Qrisp with IQM backend support
- Running quantum algorithms on real IQM hardware
- Comparing simulator vs. mock backend vs. real quantum hardware results
- Understanding NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) effects

:::{admonition} Try the Interactive Tutorial
:class: tip

Visit the **[Qrisp Starter Tutorial page](notebooks/getting-started/qrisp-starter-tutorial)** to:
- View the complete notebook with outputs
- Download it to run on your own machine
- Follow step-by-step instructions

The notebook is self-contained and portable - works locally or on cloud platforms like Google Colab!
