    "Qubit readout in superconducting systems is done via **superconducting resonators** (e.g. LC oscillators) that are coupled to the transmon qubits in the QPU. The coupling between the qubit and the resonator can be described with the [Jaynes-Cummings model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings_model), which allows for two different regimes of the system, the **resonant** and the **dispersive** one. In the latter, looking at the spectrum of the resonator, one can infer the state of the qubit thanks to the **shift** in the resonator's frequency caused by the coupling.\n",

An extra step is required: the complex number is rotated so that the difference between the states is maximal along the real axis. The real value of the signal is then compared with a **calibrated threshold value**, from which we get the well known 0/1 labels :)\n",
