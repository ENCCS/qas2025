    "# Using Dynamical Decoupling (DD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamical Decoupling (DD) is an effective error-suppression technique used to suppress errors in quantum computers. Here, we’ll explain (in basic terms) the technique behind DD, how it works, and how you can leverage IQM’s API to implement DD sequences on your quantum circuits when executing them on IQM’s quantum computers via cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "DD sequences typically consist of a series of π-pulses (180-degree rotations) applied to the qubits. These pulses are designed to refocus the qubit’s state, effectively canceling out, for example, the accumulated phase errors (Z and ZZ errors, for instance). Common DD sequences available as default sequences via IQM's cloud API include: \n",
    "- XX: A simple sequence of two π-pulses. This is also known as CPMG pulses. \n",
    "- YXYX: A sequence that alternates between X and Y pulses.\n",
    "-  XYXYYXYX: A longer sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "* ... apply the standard DD sequences on your quantum circuits.\n",
    "* ... customize your DD sequences.\n",
    "* ... build your own DD sequences. \n",

    "As an example of DD applied to a single qubit that is idling, we consider a Ramsey-like circuit, called a quantum memory circuit, following Fig. 1 of Ref. [1]. A quantum memory experiment specifically involves preparing a superposition state, waiting for a period, and then reversing the initial operation to assess coherence preservation. During the wait period (also known as the idle period), when no gates are being applied to the qubit, the qubit might accumulate errors due to, for example, a mis-aligned drive frame or residual ZZ interaction. The idea behind this circuit is to see if the coherence loss due to those error mechanisms can be avoided as a result of applying DD pulses during the wait period. The function below generates the example circuit:"

    "To create our circuits of interest, we sweep the number of zero-angle single-qubit gates (SQG) on the control qubit. Depending on the number of these gates, increasingly longer delays are created on the control qubit. The typical duration of our SQG is 20 ns. Therefore, the duration of delays is just going to be the number of gates multiplied by 20 ns. We can now run our circuits with and without DD as we do in Qiskit, but if one wants to run circuits with DD, one now additionally provides a flag for DD to be operational when submitting the circuits, as shown below. When using DD in such a default way, the API automatically chooses the so-called standard strategy. Under the standard strategy, the three DD sequences introduced in the introduction are automatically placed by looking at idles that have fitting sizes. For example, if the idles are short (i.e., three times the duration of the X gate), the XX sequence is symmetrically placed. If the idles are longer than eight times the duration of the X gate, the XYXYYXYX sequence is placed accordingly.\n",
