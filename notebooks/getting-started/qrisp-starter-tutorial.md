# Qrisp Starter Tutorial

*Get hands-on experience with Qrisp and IQM quantum hardware*

This interactive notebook introduces you to quantum programming with Qrisp and shows you how to run quantum algorithms on real IQM hardware. You'll learn the differences between simulators, mock backends, and actual quantum computers.

## What you'll learn

- Setting up Qrisp with IQM backend support
- Running quantum algorithms on real IQM hardware
- Comparing simulator vs. mock backend vs. real quantum hardware results
- Understanding NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) effects

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (NOT 3.13+ due to Qrisp compatibility)
- Jupyter notebook environment (VS Code, JupyterLab, or Google Colab)
- IQM API token from [IQM Resonance](https://resonance.meetiqm.com/)

:::{important}
**Credit Costs**: Running on real IQM hardware (Sirius) consumes credits at 0.30 credits/second. The notebook includes a **free mock backend** and **local simulator** for testing without using credits.
